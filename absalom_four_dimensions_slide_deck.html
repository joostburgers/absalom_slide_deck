    <h1 class="title">Digital Supplement: <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> and the Digital Humanities</h1>
    <h2 class="author">Johannes Burgers</h2>
    <h3 class="date">This interactive essay acts as a supplement to the long-form essay available in the <em>Norton Critical Edition</em> of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>. It includes visualizations that are not possible to represent in print, and also functions as a standalone essay that explores <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> along four different axes: Characters, Locations, Events, and Language.</h3>
</section>

<section id="introductions" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>Introductions</h1>
<p><em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is a notoriously difficult text.</p>
<p>Told from multiple, fragmentary, and contradictory perspectives through a highly convoluted stream-of-consciousness narration, the text resists any reading that establishes an ultimate meaning.</p>
</section>

<section id="and-complications" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>and Complications</h1>
<p>In that spirit, this supplement does not provide an over-arching explanation of the text, but uses different visualizations to understand different aspects of the text:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Characters</li>
<li class="fragment">Locations</li>
<li class="fragment">Events</li>
<li class="fragment">Language</li>
</ul>

<h1>Navigation</h1>
<p>While each module is interconnected, they can also be read in isolation. Each module has its own heading, and navigating down unlocks more and more detail about each particular topic.</p>

<h2>Literary Demography</h2>
<p>The <em>Digital Yoknapatawpha</em> <a href="http://faulkner.iath.virginia.edu/"><em>Digital Yoknapatawpha</em></a> database contains every character who appears in Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha fictions.</p>

<h2>Passing Thoughts</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 80%"> It is clear from reading <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> that the novel is about Charles Bon’s potential transgression across the ‘color line.’ The data reveal that the novel attends to this issue from a predominantly White perspective, and at the exclusion of all other non-white characters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 80%">The various narrators only really care about racial passing if it threatens upper class white femininity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 80%">As such, they naturalize racial difference, and also circumscribe the boundaries of gender, sexuality, and class. </span></p>

<h2>Events Overview</h2>
<p><em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> resists summary. It is told from multiple, contradictory perspectives that each re-tell the same set of historical events: Thomas Sutpen arrives in Jefferson and starts a family with Ellen Coldfield. He has a son, Henry, and a daughter, Judith. Judith falls in love with Henry’s friend from college Charles Bon. On the day Judith and Charles are supposed to marry, Henry kills him and disappears.</p>

<h2>Plotting the Plot</h2>
<p>Though the plot can be very confusing, it is clear from Faulkner’s notes that he had an underlying structure.</p>
</section>
<section id="story-vs.-plot" class="slide level2">
<h2>Story vs. Plot</h2>
<p>Often used interchangeable, <strong>story</strong> and <strong>plot</strong> describe two different aspects of a narrative.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p><strong>plot</strong> - The order of events in which they are told to the reader.</p>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<p><strong>story</strong> - The order of events as they actually occur. This is also known as <strong>chronology</strong>.</p>

<h2>Sutpen’s Story and Plot</h2>
<p>Faulkner does not tell us the events in the order they occur (<strong>story</strong>). Instead, he reorganizes them into a non-linear order (<strong>plot</strong>).</p>
<p>We can see this distinction with his delayed revelations about Sutpen’s life.</p>
</section>
<section id="sutpens-plot-and-story" class="slide level2">
<h2>Sutpen’s Plot and Story</h2>
<p>Following the order of events as Quentin discovers them, we learn several important details about him out of order:</p>

<li class="fragment"><strong>Chapter 7</strong>: Sutpen is born in Virginia</li>

<h2>Ordering Events</h2>
<p><em>Digital Yoknapatawpha</em> has broken down the novel into 644 individual events.</p>
<p>An event is any time there is one or more characters at one location for a discrete period of time.</p>
<p>Each of the 644 events in the novel was also assigned a number that indicates its order in the <strong>plot</strong> and in the <strong>story/chronology</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="plotting-events" class="slide level2">
<h2>Plotting Events</h2>
<p>We can take the <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>chronology</strong> data and put them on a chart to show the structure of the narrative.</p>
<p>Chronology is placed on the y-axis, and plot is placed on the x-axis.</p>
<p>Events that are chronologically earlier are lower down, while later events are higher up.</p>
</section>
<section id="sutpens-plot" class="slide level2">
<h2>Sutpen’s plot</h2>
<p>The <strong>plot</strong> chart shows the events as they are narrated to us, the <strong>story</strong> chart shows the order in which those events happen according to the chronology.</p>
