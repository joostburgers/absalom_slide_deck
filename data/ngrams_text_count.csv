or a man who,2,4,1,3
or at least not,2,4,1,2
or at least that,2,4,1,2
or at least the,3,4,1,3
or it may have been,2,5,1,2
or may not have,3,4,1,3
or maybe he just,2,4,1,2
or maybe it was the,2,5,1,2
or maybe she didn't,2,4,1,2
or maybe she was,2,4,1,2
or not for that,2,4,1,2
or perhaps it was,2,4,1,2
or that you would all,2,5,1,2
or was it the,2,4,1,2

over whiskey at night,2,4,1,2
paying any attention to,2,4,1,2
perhaps but at least,3,4,1,3
perhaps in the hope,2,4,1,2
perhaps it was because,2,4,1,2
perhaps she saw in,2,4,1,2
perhaps the reason was the,2,5,1,2
perhaps we do not even want to,2,7,1,2
perhaps you are right,2,4,1,2
pistol by the barrel,2,4,1,2
play with her nephew and niece,2,6,1,2
plus liquid assets plus,2,4,1,2
portico and scaling walls,2,4,1,2

probably he would have,2,4,1,2
proposed to her and,2,4,1,2
provided of course that,2,4,1,2
